#CryptoBnB

AirBnB changed the world when it popularized short-term rentals. It allowed people to list their homes to be booked by travelers who needed a place to stay. In effect, AirBnB made booking travel a peer-to-peer experience.

Is AirBnB decentralized? While it does offer peer-to-peer booking capabilities, that functionality is performed through the AirBnB app. More importantly, the bookings, data, and relationships are maintained by AirBnB. AirBnB is the facilitator of all of these transactions, making it the central governing body. Therefore no, AirBnB is not decentralized (yet).

Consider what would be required to create a decentralized list of properties for any given city. One where there is no central authority in charge of the list, but one where there is a common set of rules that govern how the list operates.
